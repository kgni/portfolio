## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript
Animations is from the AOS JavaScript library.

## Optimizations
Here is a list of what will be fixed in the future:
  + Snapscrolling (in some browsers there is a weird quirk, where it will skip a page when scrolling)
  + Add resume and skills to about section
  + Redesign project section
  + Add metatags (SEO Optimization)
  + When submitting form have a modal popup instead of redirecting to thankyou page.
  + Recreate website in React.
  + Refactoring - SASS (Too much nesting going on), create CSS variables, Have a more Object-oriented apporach when it comes to CSS. In general it is lacking structure when it comes to the styles. 

## Lessons Learned:

Learned some stuff about SASS, at the moment I have used nesting WAY too much, which makes the code really hard to grasp and read. The styling in general is not very legible - needs to refactored with a more organized approach. Learned about SEO, including meta tags.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
