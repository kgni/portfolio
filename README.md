## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, React, Tailwind, Sanity.io, Framer motion
Animations is from the AOS JavaScript library.

## Optimizations
Here is a list of what will be fixed in the future:
  + Redo it in NextJS for SSR or SSG
  + There is a bug, where the occasionally projects are not being loaded from sanity.io (seems to also be browser dependant)

## Lessons Learned:

One of my first projects using React & Tailwind. First time ever using a headless CMS (sanity.io).

Learned about React folder structure, tailwind classes, framer motion, and how to setup and use sanity.io
